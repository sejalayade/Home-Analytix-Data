Home Analytix's project aims to modernize property assessment by involving homeowners in reporting changes to their homes on a website. Using machine learning and historical data, it predicts property values, reducing costs for governments and enhancing engagement between authorities and property owners. In this project, we are analysing the dataset and making the required predictions.   

Key Points:
1. The project helps governments save money by avoiding the cost of sending people to assess properties one by one.

2. Property owners get to play a role by reporting changes to their homes, making the assessment process fairer and more transparent.
